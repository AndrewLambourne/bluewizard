	<blockquote><p>Hogan's Foodery was founded in 1983 by Todd 'Zarathustra' Hogan. 
	After a harrowing encounter with a slice of partially-chewed bologna, 
	Todd claimed he had recieved an epiphany and promptly opened his own Americana-themed 
	restaurant, the Foodery! For 36 years, Todd has been writing a personalized prophecy
	for each and every meal, a fun twist on the fortune cookie! So if you bite into one of our 
	delicious burgers or juicy hot dogs and find a prognostication inside, don't worry- 
	at the Foodery, it's fate!   
	</p></blockquote>
	
	<blockquote><p>Hogan's Foodery is located right in the bustling heart of downtown 
	Centralia, Pennsylvania. Come on down and visit- we know we'll be seeing you soon!</p></blockquote>
